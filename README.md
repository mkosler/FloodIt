# Flood It

A color flood game for One Game A Month February 2013.

## Dependencies

- Lua
- [LOVE 0.8.0](http://love2d.org/)

## Building

Lua is an interpreted language, so there is no compilation step. The most analagous
thing to a compilation step would be creating a **.love** package. Instructions for
your respective operating system can be found on the [LOVE wiki](http://www.love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution).

## Running

For Windows users, I will provide a self-contained distribution file, so all you
will need to do is download the file and run it.

If you are a Windows user and would like to run it via the source code or
if you are using any other operating system, you will need to have 
[LOVE 0.8.0](http://love2d.org/) installed on your system. Instructions on
how to run the Lua source code using LOVE can be found on the
[LOVE wiki](http://www.love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started).
